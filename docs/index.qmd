Bambi is a high-level Bayesian model-building interface written in Python. 
It works with the [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/) probabilistic programming framework and is
designed to make it extremely easy to fit Bayesian mixed-effects models common in biology,
social sciences and other disciplines.


## Dependencies

Bambi is tested on Python 3.10+ and depends on ArviZ, formulae, NumPy, pandas and PyMC 
(see [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/blob/main/pyproject.toml) 
for version information).

## Installation

Bambi is available from the Python Package Index at 
[https://pypi.org/project/bambi](https://pypi.org/project/bambi), alternatively it can be 
installed using Conda.

### PyPI

The latest release of Bambi can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

Alternatively, if you want the bleeding edge version of the package, you can install from
 GitHub:
   
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

### Conda

If you use Conda, you can also install the latest release of Bambi with the following command:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge bambi
```

## Examples

In the following two examples we assume the following basic setup

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

### Linear regression

A simple fixed effects model is shown in the example below.

```python
# Read in a dataset from the package content
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")

# See first rows
data.head()
 
# Initialize the fixed effects only model
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)

# Get model description
print(model)

# Fit the model using 1000 on each chain
results = model.fit(draws=1000)

# Key summary and diagnostic info on the model parameters
az.summary(results)

# Use ArviZ to plot the results
az.plot_trace(results)
```
``` 
   Reaction  Days  Subject
0  249.5600     0      308
1  258.7047     1      308
2  250.8006     2      308
3  321.4398     3      308
4  356.8519     4      308
```
```
       Formula: Reaction ~ Days
        Family: gaussian
          Link: mu = identity
  Observations: 180
        Priors:
    target = mu
        Common-level effects
            Intercept ~ Normal(mu: 298.5079, sigma: 261.0092)
            Days ~ Normal(mu: 0.0, sigma: 48.8915)

        Auxiliary parameters
            sigma ~ HalfStudentT(nu: 4.0, sigma: 56.1721)
```
```
                   mean     sd   hdi_3%  hdi_97%  mcse_mean  mcse_sd  ess_bulk  ess_tail  r_hat
Intercept       251.552  6.658  238.513  263.417      0.083    0.059    6491.0    2933.0    1.0

```

First, we create and build a Bambi `Model`. Then, the method `model.fit()` tells the sampler to start
running and it returns an `InferenceData` object, which can be passed to several ArviZ functions
such as `az.summary()` to get a summary of the parameters distribution and sample diagnostics or
`az.plot_trace()` to visualize them.

### Logistic regression

In this example we will use a simulated dataset created as shown below.

```python
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})
```

Here we just add the `family` argument set to `"bernoulli"` to tell Bambi we are modelling a binary
response. By default, it uses a logit link. We can also use some syntax sugar to specify which event
we want to model. We just say `g['Yes']` and Bambi will understand we want to model the probability
of a `"Yes"` response. But this notation is not mandatory. If we use `"g ~ x1 + x2"`, Bambi will
pick one of the events to model and will inform us which one it picked.

```python
model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```

After this, we can evaluate the model as before.
