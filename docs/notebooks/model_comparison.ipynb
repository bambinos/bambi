    "We are only using the following variables in this example: **income**, **sex**, **race**, **age**, and **hs_week**. This subset is comprised of both categorical and numerical variables which allows us to visualize how to incorporate both types in a logistic regression model while helping to keep the analysis simpler."

In all the cases, we see the probability of making more than $50K increases with age until approximately age 52, when the probability begins to drop off.

    "### Final remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we've seen how easy it is to incorporate ArviZ into a Bambi workflow to perform model comparison based on information criteria such as **LOO** and **WAIC**. However, an attentive reader might have seen that the highest density interval plot never shows a predicted probability greater than 0.5 (which is not good if we expect to predict that at least some people working 40hrs/wk make more than \\\\$50k/yr). You can increase the hours of work per week for the profiles we've used and the HDIs will show larger values. But we won't be seeing the whole picture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although we're using some demographic variables such as **sex** and **race**, the cells resulting from the combinations of their levels are still very heterogeneous. For example, we are mixing individuals of all educational levels. A possible next step is to **incorporate education** into the different models we compared. If any of the readers (yes, you!) is interested in doing so, here there are some notes that may help \n",
    "\n",
    "* Education is an ordinal categorical variable with a lot of levels. \n",
    "    + Explore the conditional distribution of income given education levels.\n",
    "    + See what are the counts/proportions of people within each education level.\n",
    "    + Collapse categories (but respect the ordinality!). Try to end up with 5 or less categories if possible.\n",
    "* Start with a model with only **age**, **sex**, **race**, **hs_week** and **education**. Then incorporate higher order  terms (second and third powers for example). Don't go beyond fourth powers.\n",
    "* Look for a nice activity to do while the sampler does its job.  \n",
    "We know it's going to take a couple of hours to fit all those models :) \n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, please feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi/issues) if you think there's something that we can improve."
