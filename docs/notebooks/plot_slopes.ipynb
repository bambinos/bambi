    "# Plot Slopes\n",
    "\n",
    "Bambi's sub-package `interpret` features a set of functions to help interpret complex regression models. The sub-package is inspired by the R package [marginaleffects](https://marginaleffects.com/chapters/predictions.html#conditional-predictions). In this notebook we will discuss two functions `slopes` and `plot_slopes`. These two functions allow the modeler to easier interpret slopes, either by a inspecting a summary output or plotting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, it is described why estimating the slope of the prediction function is useful in interpreting generalized linear models (GLMs), how this methodology is implemented in Bambi, and how to use `slopes` and `plot_slopes`. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basics of GLMs. If not, refer to the Bambi [Basic Building Blocks](https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/notebooks/how_bambi_works.html#Link-functions) example."

    "\n",
    "Assuming we have fit a linear regression model of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_k x_k + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the \"safest\" interpretation of the regression coefficients $\\beta$ is as a comparison between two groups of items that differ by $1$ in the relevant predictor variable $x_i$ while being identical in all the other predictors. Formally, the predicted difference between two items $i$ and $j$ that differ by an amount $n$ on predictor $k$, but are identical on all other predictors, the predicted difference is $y_i - y_j$ is $\\beta_kx$, on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, once we move away from a regression model with a Gaussian response, the identity function, and no interaction terms, the interpretation of the coefficients are not as straightforward. For example, in a logistic regression model, the coefficients are on a different scale and are measured in logits (log odds), not probabilities or percentage points. Thus, you cannot interpret the coefficents as a \"one unit increase in $x_k$ is associated with an $n$ percentage point decrease in $y$\". First, the logits must be converted to the probability scale. Secondly, a one unit change in $x_k$ may produce a larger or smaller change in the outcome, depending upon how far away from zero the logits are. \n",
    "\n",
    "`slopes` and `plot_slopes`, by default, computes quantities of interest on the response scale for GLMs. For example, for a logistic regression model, this is the probability scale, and for a Poisson regression model, this is the count scale."

    "### Interpreting interaction effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying interactions in a regression model is a way of allowing parameters to be conditional on certain aspects of the data. By contrast, for a model with no interactions, the parameters are **not** conditional and thus, the value of one parameter is not dependent on the value of another covariate. However, once interactions exist, multiple parameters are always in play at the same time. Additionally, interactions can be specified for either categorical, continuous, or both types of covariates. Thus, making the interpretation of the parameters more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "With GLMs, every covariate essentially interacts with itself because of the link function. To demonstrate parameters interacting with themselves, consider the mean of a Gaussian linear model with an identity link function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\alpha + \\beta x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the rate of change in $\\mu$ with respect to $x$ is just $\\beta$, i.e., the rate of change is constant no matter what the value of $x$ is. But when we consider GLMs with link functions used to map outputs to exponential family distribution parameters, calculating the derivative of the mean output $\\mu$ with respect to the predictor is not as straightforward as in the Gaussian linear model. For example, computing the rate of change in a binomial probability $p$ with respect to $x$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\frac{exp(\\alpha + \\beta x)}{1 + exp(\\alpha + \\beta x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And taking the derivative of $p$ with respect to $x$ yields\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\beta}{2(1 + cosh(\\alpha + \\beta x))}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $x$ appears in the derivative, the impact of a change in $x$ depends upon $x$, i.e., an interaction with itself even though no interaction term was specified in the model.Thus, visualizing the rate of change in the mean response with respect to a covariate $x$ becomes a useful tool in interpreting GLMs."

    "## Average Predictive Slopes\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we adopt the notation from Chapter 14.4 of [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) to first describe average predictive differences which is essential to computing `slopes`, and then secondly, average predictive slopes. Assume we have fit a Bambi model predicting an outcome $Y$ based on inputs $X$ and parameters $\\theta$. Consider the following scalar inputs:\n",

    "$$X = (w, c)$$\n",

The difference between these two terms is the average predictive difference.\n",

    "\n",
    "The objective of `slopes` and `plot_slopes` is to compute the rate of change (slope) in the mean of the response $y$ with respect to a small change $\\epsilon$ in the predictor $x$ conditional on other covariates $c$ specified in the model. $w$ is specified by the user and the original value is either provided by the user, else a default value (the mean) is computed by Bambi. The values for the other covariates $c$ specified in the model can be determined under the following three scenarios:\n",

In (3), Bambi uses the original $c$, and adds a small amount $\\epsilon$ to each unit of observation's $w$. In each scenario, predictions are made on the data using the fitted model. Once the predictions are made, comparisons are computed using the posterior samples by taking the difference in the predicted outcome for each pair of transitions and dividing by $\\epsilon$. The average of these slopes is the average predictive slopes.\n",

A default value is computed for the unspecified covariates because in order to peform predictions, Bambi is expecting a value for each covariate used to fit the model. Additionally, with GLM models, average predictive slopes are conditional in the sense that the estimate depends on the values of **all** the covariates in the model. Thus, for unspecified covariates, `slopes` and `plot_slopes` computes a default value (mean or mode based on the data type of the covariate). Each row in the summary dataframe is read as \"the slope (or rate of change) of the probability of switching wells with respect to a small change in $w$ conditional on $c$ is $y$\"."

Specifically, one interaction is added between `dist100` and `educ4`, and another between `arsenic` and `educ4`."

Similarly, a negative value for `arsenic:educ4` indicates that the \"effect\" of arsenic on the outcome is more negative as education increases. Remember, these coefficients are still on the logit scale. Furthermore, as more variables and interaction terms are added to the model, interpreting these coefficients becomes more difficult. \n",

Notice in the code block below how parameters are passed to the `subplot_kwargs` and `fig_kwargs` arguments. At times, it can be useful to pass specific `group` and `panel` arguments to aid in the interpretation of the plot. Therefore, `subplot_kwargs` allows the user to manipulate the plotting by passing a dictionary where the keys are `{\"main\": ..., \"group\": ..., \"panel\": ...}` and the values are the names of the covariates to be plotted. `fig_kwargs` are figure level key word arguments such as a theme dictionary (dictionary of matplotlib rc parameters)."

Thus, it may be desireable to use the empirical distribution of $c$ to compute the predictive slopes, and then average over a specific or set of covariates to obtain average slopes.

However, for $w$, the values are the original $w$ value plus $\\epsilon$. Thus, the `estimate` value represents the instantaneous rate of change for that unit of observation. However, these unit level slopes are difficult to interpret since each row may have a different slope estimate. Therefore, it is useful to average over (marginalize) the estimates to summarize the unit level predictive slopes."

    "### Interpreting coefficients as an elasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "In some fields, such as economics, it is useful to interpret the results of a regression model in terms of an elasticity (a percent change in $x$ is associated with a percent change in $y$) or semi-elasticity (a unit change in $x$ is associated with a percent change in $y$, or vice versa). Typically, this is achieved by fitting a model where either the outcome and or the covariates are log-transformed. However, since the log transformation is performed by the modeler, to compute elasticities for `slopes` and `plot_slopes`, Bambi \"post-processes\" the predictions to compute the elasticities. Below, it is shown the possible elasticity arguments and how they are computed for `slopes` and `plot_slopes`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `eyex`: a percentage point increase in $x_1$ is associated with an $n$ percentage point increase in $y$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial x_1} * \\frac{x_1}{\\hat{y}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- `eydx`: a unit increase in $x_1$ is associated with an $n$ percentage point increase in $y$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial x_1} * \\frac{1}{\\hat{y}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dyex`: a percentage point increase in $x_1$ is associated with an $n$ unit increase in $y$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial x_1} * x_1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, each code cell shows the same model, and `wrt` and `conditional` argument, but with a different elasticity (`slope`) argument. By default, `dydx` (a derivative with no post-processing) is used."
