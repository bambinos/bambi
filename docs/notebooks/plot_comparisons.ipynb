   "source": "# Plot Comparisons\n\n`comparisons` and `plot_comparisons` are a part of Bambi's sub-package `interpret` that features a set of functions used to interpret complex regression models. This sub-package is inspired by the R package [marginaleffects](https://marginaleffects.com/chapters/predictions.html#conditional-predictions). These two functions allow the modeler to **compare** the predictions made by a model for different contrast and covariate values. Below, it is described why comparing predictions is useful in interpreting generalized linear models (GLMs), how this methodology is implemented in Bambi, and how to use `comparisons` and `plot_comparisons`. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basics of GLMs. If not, refer to the Bambi [Basic Building Blocks](https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/notebooks/how_bambi_works.html#Link-functions) example.\n\nDue to the link function in a GLM, there are typically three quantities of interest to interpret:\n\n1. the linear predictor $\\eta = X\\beta$ where $X$ is an $n$ x $p$ matrix of explanatory variables.\n2. the mean $\\mu = g^{-1}(\\eta)$ where the link function $g(\\cdot)$ relates the linear predictor to the mean of the outcome variable $\\mu = g^{-1}(\\eta) = g^{-1}(X\\beta)$\n3. the response variable $Y \\sim \\mathcal{D}(\\mu, \\theta)$ where $\\mu$ is the mean parameter and $\\theta$ is (possibly) a vector that contains all the other \"auxiliary\" parameters of the distribution.\n \nOften, with GLMs, $\\eta$ is linear in the parameters, but nonlinear in relation of inputs to the outcome $Y$ due to the link function $g$. Thus, as modelers, we are usually more interested in interpreting (2) and (3). For example, in logistic regression, the linear predictor is on the log-odds scale, but the quantity of interest is on the probability scale. In Poisson regression, the linear predictor is on the log-scale, but the response variable is on the count scale. Referring back to logistic regression, a specified difference in one of the $x$ variables does _not_ correspond to a constant difference in the the probability of the outcome.\n\nIt is often helpful with GLMs, for the modeler and audience, to have a summary that gives the expected difference in the outcome corresponding to a unit difference in each of the input variables. Thus, the goal of `comparisons` and `plot_comparisons` is to provide the modeler with a summary and visualization of the average predicted difference."

    "## Average Predictive Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we adopt the notation from Chapter 14.4 of [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) to describe average predictive differences. Assume we have fit a Bambi model predicting an outcome $Y$ based on inputs $X$ and parameters $\\theta$. Consider the following scalar inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w: \\text{the input of interest}$$\n",
    "$$c: \\text{all the other inputs}$$\n",
    "$$X = (w, c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose for the input of interest, we are interested in comparing $w^{\\text{high}}$ to $w^{\\text{low}}$ (perhaps age = $60$ and $40$ respectively) with all other inputs $c$ held constant. The _predictive difference_ in the outcome changing **only** $w$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{average predictive difference} = \\mathbb{E}(y|w^{\\text{high}}, c, \\theta) - \\mathbb{E}(y|w^{\\text{low}}, c, \\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the maximum and minimum values of $w$ and averaging over all other inputs $c$ in the data gives you a new \"hypothetical\" dataset and corresponds to counting all pairs of transitions of $(w^\\text{low})$ to $(w^\\text{high})$, i.e., differences in $w$ with $c$ held constant. The difference between these two terms is the average predictive difference."

    "### Computing Average Predictive Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of `comparisons` and `plot_comparisons` is to compute the expected difference in the outcome corresponding to three different scenarios for $w$ and $c$ where $w$ is either provided by the user, else a default value is computed by Bambi (described in the default values section). The three scenarios are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. user provided values for $c$.\n",
    "2. a grid of equally spaced and central values for $c$.\n",
    "3. empirical distribution (original data used to fit the model) for $c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of (1) and (2) above, Bambi assembles all pairwise combinations (transitions) of $w$ and $c$ into a new \"hypothetical\" dataset. In (3), Bambi uses the original $c$, but replaces $w$ with the user provided value or the default value computed by Bambi. In each scenario, predictions are made on the data using the fitted model. Once the predictions are made, comparisons are computed using the posterior samples by taking the difference in the predicted outcome for each pair of transitions. The average of these differences is the average predictive difference. \n",

For example, if we wanted to compare the number of fish caught for $4$ versus $1$ `persons` conditional on a range of `child` and `livebait` values, we would pass the following dictionary in the code block below. By default, for $w$, Bambi compares $w^\\text{high}$ to $w^\\text{low}$. Thus, in this example, $w^\\text{high}$ = 4 and $w^\\text{low}$ = 1. The user is not limited to passing a list for the values. A `np.array` can also be used. Furthermore, Bambi by default, maps the order of the dict keys to the main, group, and panel of the matplotlib figure. Below, since `child` is the first key, this is used for the x-axis, and `livebait` is used for the group (color). If a third key was passed, it would be used for the panel (facet)."

Below, it is described how these default values are computed.\n",

For example, if the modeler is interested in the comparison of a $5$ unit increase in $w$ where $w$ is a numeric variable, Bambi computes the mean and then subtracts and adds $2.5$ units to the mean to obtain a _centered difference_. By default, if no value is passed for the contrast covariate, Bambi computes a one unit centered difference at the mean. For example, if only `contrast=\"persons\"` is passed, then $\\pm$ $0.5$ is applied to the mean of persons. If $w$ is a categorical variable, Bambi computes and returns the unique levels. For example, if $w$ has levels [\"high scool\", \"vocational\", \"university\"], Bambi computes and returns the unique values of this variable.\n",

Currently, by default, if a dict or list is passed to `conditional`, Bambi uses the ordering (keys if dict and elements if list) to determine which covariate to use as the main, group (color), and panel (facet) variable. This is the same logic used in `plot_comparisons` described above. Subsequently, the default values used for the `conditional` covariates depend on their ordering **and** dtype. Below, the psuedocode used for computing default values covariates passed to `conditional` is outlined:\n",

    "if v == \"main\":\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if v == numeric:\n",
    "        return np.linspace(v.min(), v.max(), 50)\n",

    "    if v == numeric:\n",
    "        return np.quantile(v, np.linspace(0, 1, 5))\n",
    "    elif v == categorical:\n",
    "        return np.unique(v)\n",
