# See documentation on accesing the tag from the release
# Look for 'github.ref' and 'github.ref_name' in https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts 
# On October, 2023 it says "For workflows triggered by release, this is the release tag created"
# So 'github.ref_name' should be the version number of the release we're making.
