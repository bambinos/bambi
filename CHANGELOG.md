Many changes are included in this release. Some of the most important changes are

* New model families (StudentT, Binomial, Beta).
* In-sample and out-of-sample predictions.
* Improved sampling performance due to predictor centering when the model contains an intercept.
* New default priors (similar to rstanarm default priors).
* It's possible to use potentials.
* There's a new function to load datasets used throughout examples
