class Model:
    """Specification of model class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    formula : str or bambi.formula.Formula
        A model description written using the formula syntax from the ``formulae`` library.
    data : pandas.DataFrame
        A pandas dataframe containing the data on which the model will be fit, with column
        names matching variables defined in the formula.
    family : str or bambi.families.Family
        A specification of the model family (analogous to the family object in R). Either
        a string, or an instance of class ``bambi.families.Family``. If a string is passed, a
        family with the corresponding name must be defined in the defaults loaded at ``Model``
        initialization. Valid pre-defined families are ``"bernoulli"``, ``"beta"``,
        ``"binomial"``, ``"categorical"``, ``"gamma"``, ``"gaussian"``, ``"negativebinomial"``,
        ``"poisson"``, ``"t"``, and ``"wald"``. Defaults to ``"gaussian"``.
    priors : dict
        Optional specification of priors for one or more terms. A dictionary where the keys are
        the names of terms in the model, "common," or "group_specific" and the values are
        instances of class ``Prior``. If priors are unset, uses automatic priors inspired by
        the R rstanarm library.
    link : str or Dict[str, str]
        The name of the link function to use. Valid names are ``"cloglog"``, ``"identity"``,
        ``"inverse_squared"``, ``"inverse"``, ``"log"``, ``"logit"``, ``"probit"``, and
        ``"softmax"``. Not all the link functions can be used with all the families.
        If a dictionary, keys are the names of the target parameters and the values are the names
        of the link functions.
    categorical : str or list
        The names of any variables to treat as categorical. Can be either a single variable
        name, or a list of names. If categorical is ``None``, the data type of the columns in
        the ``data`` will be used to infer handling. In cases where numeric columns are
        to be treated as categorical (e.g., group specific factors coded as numerical IDs),
        explicitly passing variable names via this argument is recommended.
    potentials : A list of 2-tuples.
        Optional specification of potentials. A potential is an arbitrary expression added to the
        likelihood, this is generally useful to add constrains to models, that are difficult to
        express otherwise. The first term of a 2-tuple is the name of a variable in the model, the
        second a lambda function expressing the desired constraint.
        If a constraint involves n variables, you can pass n 2-tuples or pass a tuple which first
        element is a n-tuple and second element is a lambda function with n arguments. The number
        and order of the lambda function has to match the number and order of the variables names.
    dropna : bool
        When ``True``, rows with any missing values in either the predictors or outcome are
        automatically dropped from the dataset in a listwise manner.
    auto_scale : bool
        If ``True`` (default), priors are automatically rescaled to the data
        (to be weakly informative) any time default priors are used. Note that any priors
        explicitly set by the user will always take precedence over default priors.
    noncentered : bool
        If ``True`` (default), uses a non-centered parameterization for normal hyperpriors on
        grouped parameters. If ``False``, naive (centered) parameterization is used.
    center_predictors : bool
        If ``True`` (default), and if there is an intercept in the common terms, the data is
        centered by subtracting the mean. The centering is undone after sampling to provide
        the actual intercept in all distributional components that have an intercept. Note
        that this changes the interpretation of the prior on the intercept because it refers
        to the intercept of the centered data.
    extra_namespace : dict, optional
        Additional user supplied variables with transformations or data to include in the
        environment where the formula is evaluated. Defaults to `None`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        draws: int
            The number of samples to draw from the posterior distribution. Defaults to 1000.
        tune : int
            Number of iterations to tune. Defaults to 1000. Samplers adjust the step sizes,
            scalings or similar during tuning. These tuning samples are be drawn in addition to the
            number specified in the ``draws`` argument, and will be discarded unless
            ``discard_tuned_samples`` is set to ``False``.
        discard_tuned_samples : bool
            Whether to discard posterior samples of the tune interval. Defaults to ``True``.
        omit_offsets : bool
            Omits offset terms in the ``InferenceData`` object returned when the model includes
            group specific effects. Defaults to ``True``.
        include_mean : bool
            Compute the posterior of the mean response. Defaults to ``False``.
        inference_method : str
            The method to use for fitting the model. By default, ``"mcmc"``. This automatically
            assigns a MCMC method best suited for each kind of variables, like NUTS for continuous
            variables and Metropolis for non-binary discrete ones. Alternatively, ``"vi"``, in
            which case the model will be fitted using variational inference as implemented in PyMC
            using the ``fit`` function.
            Finally, ``"laplace"``, in which case a Laplace approximation is used and is not
            recommended other than for pedagogical use.
            To use the PyMC numpyro and blackjax samplers, use ``nuts_numpyro`` or ``nuts_blackjax``
            respectively. Both methods will only work if you can use NUTS sampling, so your model
            must be differentiable.
        init : str
            Initialization method. Defaults to ``"auto"``. The available methods are:
            * auto: Use ``"jitter+adapt_diag"`` and if this method fails it uses ``"adapt_diag"``.
            * adapt_diag: Start with a identity mass matrix and then adapt a diagonal based on the
            variance of the tuning samples. All chains use the test value (usually the prior mean)
            as starting point.
            * jitter+adapt_diag: Same as ``"adapt_diag"``, but use test value plus a uniform jitter
            in [-1, 1] as starting point in each chain.
            * advi+adapt_diag: Run ADVI and then adapt the resulting diagonal mass matrix based on
            the sample variance of the tuning samples.
            * advi+adapt_diag_grad: Run ADVI and then adapt the resulting diagonal mass matrix based
            on the variance of the gradients during tuning. This is **experimental** and might be
            removed in a future release.
            * advi: Run ADVI to estimate posterior mean and diagonal mass matrix.
            * advi_map: Initialize ADVI with MAP and use MAP as starting point.
            * map: Use the MAP as starting point. This is strongly discouraged.
            * adapt_full: Adapt a dense mass matrix using the sample covariances. All chains use the
            test value (usually the prior mean) as starting point.
            * jitter+adapt_full: Same as ``"adapt_full"``, but use test value plus a uniform jitter
            in [-1, 1] as starting point in each chain.
        n_init : int
            Number of initialization iterations. Only works for ``"advi"`` init methods.
        chains : int
            The number of chains to sample. Running independent chains is important for some
            convergence statistics and can also reveal multiple modes in the posterior. If ``None``,
            then set to either ``cores`` or 2, whichever is larger.
        cores : int
            The number of chains to run in parallel. If ``None``, it is equal to the number of CPUs
            in the system unless there are more than 4 CPUs, in which case it is set to 4.
        random_seed : int or list of ints
            A list is accepted if cores is greater than one.

            For other kwargs see the documentation for ``PyMC.sample()``.

        Samples from the prior distribution and plots its marginals.

        Parameters
        ----------
        draws : int
            Number of draws to sample from the prior predictive distribution. Defaults to 5000.
        var_names : str or list
            A list of names of variables for which to compute the prior predictive
            distribution. Defaults to ``None`` which means to include both observed and
            unobserved RVs.
        random_seed : int
            Seed for the random number generator.
        figsize : tuple
            Figure size. If ``None`` it will be defined automatically.
        textsize : float
            Text size scaling factor for labels, titles and lines. If ``None`` it will be
            autoscaled based on ``figsize``.
        hdi_prob : float or str
            Plots highest density interval for chosen percentage of density.
            Use ``"hide"`` to hide the highest density interval. Defaults to 0.94.
        round_to : int
            Controls formatting of floats. Defaults to 2 or the integer part, whichever is bigger.
        point_estimate : str
            Plot point estimate per variable. Values should be ``"mean"``, ``"median"``, ``"mode"``
            or ``None``. Defaults to ``"auto"`` i.e. it falls back to default set in
            ArviZ's rcParams.
        kind : str
            Type of plot to display (``"kde"`` or ``"hist"``) For discrete variables this argument
            is ignored and a histogram is always used.
        bins : integer or sequence or "auto"
            Controls the number of bins, accepts the same keywords ``matplotlib.pyplot.hist()``
            does. Only works if ``kind == "hist"``. If ``None`` (default) it will use ``"auto"``
            for continuous variables and ``range(xmin, xmax + 1)`` for discrete variables.
        omit_offsets : bool
            Whether to omit offset terms in the plot. Defaults to ``True``.
        omit_group_specific : bool
            Whether to omit group specific effects in the plot. Defaults to ``True``.
        ax : numpy array-like of matplotlib axes or bokeh figures
            A 2D array of locations into which to plot the densities. If not supplied, ArviZ will
            create its own array of plot areas (and return it).
        **kwargs
            Passed as-is to ``matplotlib.pyplot.hist()`` or ``matplotlib.pyplot.plot()`` function

            probability distribution for a new observation) in addition to the mean posterior
            distribution. Defaults to ``"mean"``.
        data : pandas.DataFrame or None
            An optional data frame with values for the predictors that are used to obtain
            out-of-sample predictions. If omitted, the original dataset is used.
        inplace : bool
            If ``True`` it will modify ``idata`` in-place. Otherwise, it will return a copy of
            ``idata`` with the predictions added. If ``kind="mean"``, a new variable ending in

        include_group_specific : bool
            Determines if predictions incorporate group-specific effects. If ``False``, predictions
            are made with common effects only (i.e. group specific are set to zero). Defaults to
            ``True``.
        sample_new_groups : bool
            Specifies if it is allowed to obtain predictions for new groups of group-specific terms.
            When ``True``, each posterior sample for the new groups is drawn from the posterior
            draws of a randomly selected existing group. Since different groups may be selected at
            each draw, the end result represents the variation across existing groups.

        Requires graphviz, which may be installed most easily with
            ``conda install -c conda-forge python-graphviz``

        Alternatively, you may install the ``graphviz`` binaries yourself, and then
        ``pip install graphviz`` to get the python bindings.
        See http://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html for more information.

        Parameters
        ----------
        formatting : str
            One of ``"plain"`` or ``"plain_with_params"``. Defaults to ``"plain"``.
        name : str
            Name of the figure to save. Defaults to ``None``, no figure is saved.
        figsize : tuple
            Maximum width and height of figure in inches. Defaults to ``None``, the figure size is
            set automatically. If defined and the drawing is larger than the given size, the drawing
            is uniformly scaled down so that it fits within the given size.  Only works if ``name``
            is not ``None``.
        dpi : int
            Point per inch of the figure to save.
            Defaults to 300. Only works if ``name`` is not ``None``.
        fmt : str
            Format of the figure to save.
            Defaults to ``"png"``. Only works if ``name`` is not ``None``.

        Returns
        -------
        graphviz.Digraph
